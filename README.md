# JS Campo Minato Grid

A client-side web application that implements the classic Minesweeper (Campo Minato) game. Players interact with a dynamically generated grid, aiming to uncover all safe cells while avoiding hidden mines.

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Grid Generation**: The game board, composed of individual cells, is dynamically created, allowing for flexible board sizes (implied, as it's a JS project with a grid container).
*   **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can click on cells to reveal their content, with the game logic handling mine detection and score updates.
*   **Visual Game Board**: A clear and structured grid layout provides an intuitive interface for gameplay.

## Tech Stack

*   **HTML5**: Provides the structural foundation of the web page.
*   **CSS3**: Styles the game grid and individual cells, utilizing custom properties and Bootstrap for responsive layout and common components.
*   **JavaScript**: Powers the core game logic, including grid creation, mine placement, click handling, and game state management.
